# Long-Term Stock Analysis Project

## 1. Introduction

### <u>A - Project vision</u>
The Long-Term Stock Analysis Project is a personal tool developed to automate fundamental investment research and remove emotional bias from the decision-making process. 

Deeply inspired by Raphaël Carteni’s book, "La Magie des Dividendes", the application implements a strict Dividend Growth Investing (DGI) methodology by analyzing balance sheet safety, payout sustainability, and historical growth trends. 

By centralizing key financial metrics and automated scoring into a single dashboard, this project aims to efficiently identify high-quality companies capable of delivering sustainable compound interest over the long term.


### <u>B - Strategy Focus (DGI)</u>
This project is specifically tailored for the **DGI strategy**. It doesn't just look at current prices; it analyzes the sustainability and growth potential of dividends by examining:
* **Profitability & Safety**: Evaluation of ROE, ROA, and Interest Coverage.
* **Dividend Sustainability**: Deep dive into Payout Ratios (Earnings and FCF based).
* **Historical Trends**: 5-year analysis of Revenue, Net Income, and Cash Flow.
